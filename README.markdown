Remail is RESTful email for Rails.

Forget configuring SMTP servers and queues, just use Remail. 
Remail uses Google App Engine to send and receive emails RESTfully.

## Features
* ActionMailer POSTs emails to your Remail App Engine in order to send them
* Remail POSTs received emails back to a configurable URL
  * Remail will sent an Email hash with the following attributes:
    * raw - The raw content of the message
    * sender - Whom sent it
    * subject - The subject of the incoming message
    * to - Who it was intend it to
    * date - Send date of the message
    
* Remail will retry the callback if the endpoint is not available

## Setup
* Configure settings.yaml:
  * Create a random api_key, for example using uuidgen.
  * Add a publicly accessible callback url.
* [Create](https://appengine.google.com/) a Google App Engine application.
* Configure app.yaml with the new app id.
* Upload the engine to Google App Engine (see their [docs](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs))
* Install the [Remail gem](http://github.com/maccman/remail) (sudo gem install remail).

* Attachment support.
